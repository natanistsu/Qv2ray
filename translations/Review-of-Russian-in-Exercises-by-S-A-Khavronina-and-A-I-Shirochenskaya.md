The book consists of 25 chapters, each covering a specific grammatical topic, such as nouns, verbs, cases, aspects, participles, gerunds, etc. Each chapter contains a brief explanation of the rules, followed by numerous exercises of various types and levels of difficulty. The exercises range from filling in the blanks and choosing the correct form to translating sentences and writing texts. The book also includes a key to the exercises and an index of grammatical terms.
 
The main advantage of this book is that it provides a comprehensive and systematic practice of all the essential aspects of Russian grammar. The book is suitable for both beginners and intermediate learners, as it covers the basic and advanced topics alike. The book can be used as a supplement to any course or textbook, or as a self-study material. The book is also useful for teachers who need a reliable source of exercises for their students.
 
The main drawback of this book is that it is rather old-fashioned and does not reflect the modern usage and trends of the Russian language. Some of the exercises are outdated or irrelevant, such as those involving Soviet institutions or historical figures. Some of the rules are too prescriptive or simplified, such as those concerning word order or stylistic nuances. The book also lacks cultural and communicative aspects of the language, such as idioms, slang, or pragmatics.
 
In conclusion, Russian in Exercises is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to master the Russian grammar through intensive and varied practice. However, it should be used with caution and supplemented by other materials that reflect the contemporary and dynamic nature of the Russian language.
